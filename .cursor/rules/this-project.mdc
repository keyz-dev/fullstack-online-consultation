1. All UI components must fully support Tailwind CSS dark mode by utilizing the `dark:` variant alongside their default (light) styles. For example:

   - `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900`
   - `text-primary dark:text-white`
   - `hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700`

2. When creating or updating UI components, always ensure that every color, background, border, and text style adapts appropriately to both light and dark themes.

3. Test all components in both light and dark modes to guarantee visual consistency and accessibility.

4. If you find yourself repeating the same light/dark class combinations, extract them into reusable className variables or utility functions for maintainability.

5. Example usage:

   ```tsx
   <div className="bg-light_bg dark:bg-gray-900 text-primary dark:text-white">
     {/* ... */}
   </div>
   ```

6. Leverage the project's global dark mode configuration (e.g., Tailwind's `class` strategy) to ensure theme toggling works as expected across all components.
